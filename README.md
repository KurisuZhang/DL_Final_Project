## Dataset
The dataset we used is locate [here](https://www.udacity.com/lyft-challenge), which is generated via CARLA self-driving car simulator. The data set contains sets of RGB and the corresponding semantic segments, with 5 sets of 1000 images and corresponding labels.
## Model
The network has 31,042,007 of trainable parameters and realized a 97.71\% test accuracy.
